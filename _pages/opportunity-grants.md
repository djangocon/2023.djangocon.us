## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are opportunity grants?
They are grants to encourage and facilitate the participation of those who otherwise might not be able to attend the conference.
They can be used for conference-related expenses like travel, lodging, etc.

### Why did the name change to "opportunity grants"?
We renamed "financial aid" to "opportunity grants" to become a more inclusive and diverse conference.
We feel the wording "opportunity grants" makes a positive shift towards being a thriving, supportive and trusting community.

{% endcomment %}

You should have received your notification. If you haven't, please email the opportunity grant team at [{{ site.opportunity_grants_email }}](mailto:{{ site.opportunity_grants_email }}).

### Do I need to be a speaker, a first-time attendee, or a member of an underrepresented group to receive an opportunity grant?

We try to allocate opportunity grants to a diverse set of attendees based on need.
Our review process is holistic and considers many different factors, most notably the impact we think attending DjangoCon US will have on the applicant.
{% comment %}We want to encourage everyone who needs aid to apply for it. Do not rule yourself out before you have even applied! {% endcomment %}

### When will I receive my opportunity grant?

The opportunity grant is paid to the recipient at the conference or shortly after.

### How will I receive my opportunity grant?

The opportunity grant is paid to the recipient in a check for US account holders.
A bank transfer is used for non-US account holders.
We typically use TransferWise for international payments but have used other services for currencies they do not support.

We require receipts for the items that the opportunity grant was spent on.

### Is there anything I should know if I am traveling into the US from another country?

If you are traveling into the United States, we strongly encourage you to wait to purchase airfare or book a hotel room until after your visa has been accepted.

You can request a visa letter at <a href="/invitation">Get Invitation Letter</a>.

### What if there is an emergency and I cannot attend?

If you are denied entry to the US with a valid visa, we will pay your non-refundable costs (up to the amount of your opportunity grant).
For other emergencies or additional costs, we will review the recipient's needs on a case-by-case basis.

### How To Donate

[Become a Sponsor](/sponsors/information/)! You or your company can sponsor at a specific level or sponsor a particular need, such as wifi, meals, or sprints.
Contact our <a href="mailto:{{site.sponsors_email}}">sponsorship chair</a> directly to find out how you can sponsor us.

You may also donate directly to the Opportunity Grant Fund by buying an extra ticket for an attendee who couldn't otherwise afford it when you purchase your ticket. Alternatively, you can add a dollar amount of your choosing.
