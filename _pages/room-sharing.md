Do you want to share a room [one of the hotels](/venue/#welcome) with other attendees, or do you have local accommodation available? Do you want to drive to DjangoCon US from Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, or other relatively nearby cities?

We have a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-MESCzq4TmzGf8t1V2FZmdVTfuwuwxBR8mlnPKOa0UU/edit?usp=sharing) just for you! There are tabs for people who already have room
reservations and are looking for roommates, who haven't yet booked anything, who live locally and want to offer
their homes as accommodation, and who will be driving to Durham and need car buddies.

If you're looking for a room, list your contact information along with:

- How many other people you want to share with
- What nights you'll be there
- Whether you've already reserved a room
- Any other requirements (e.g. man/woman, smoking/non, snoring/non, etc.)

If you're looking for or offering a ride, list your contact information along with the dates you're travelling and where you're coming from.

**Note:** If any of your roommates will be arriving separately, be sure to list their names on the reservation as having permission to check in and get a key to your shared room from the front desk by showing photo ID.

When reserving your room, be sure to specify the type and number of beds. Some rooms only have a single king size bed.

**Caution:** Room and ride sharing arrangements are the responsibilities of the individual parties involved. DEFNA, DSF, and DjangoCon US staff take no responsibility, and cannot be involved in any disputes.
