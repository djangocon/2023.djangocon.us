## About the Event

DjangoCon US is not possible without your support. The spirit of the event focuses on providing a platform for new and experiences speakers to share their stories and knowledge.

### Our goal is to keep ticket costs low while providing:

- Free childcare stipends
- Opportunity grants
- A lactation room
- Meals
- A centrally located venue
- Reimbursement for speaker travel and lodging expenses
- A networking party to start the event.

The DjangoCon US Slack channel currently has 700+ members where attendees get and give advice, discuss Django/Python issues, and all-around support each other, establishing a year-round connection that helps ensure the conference is as welcoming and comfortable as possible.

We promote our sponsors on our @djangocon Twitter account, which has over 13K followers, and our [@djangocon@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@djangocon) Mastodon account . Our posts are seen around the world.

In the event that a profit is made from our fundraising efforts, we pay it forward by making a donation to the Django Software Foundation and supporting other Django events in North America who support our mission.

Endless thanks for your support, and we cannot wait to call you a partner in our mission.

Because the conference is organized by [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, your sponsorship is tax-deductible!

## Sponsorship Levels

### Diversity Sponsorships

Django and the Python community at large pride themselves on their commitment to diversity and inclusion. Talk to us about contributing to our Opportunity Grant Fund, which prioritizes grants for people from underrepresented groups. Diversity sponsorship funds will also be used to offset the cost of offering child care!

#### T-Shirts! Included in Gold Tier +

Sign your sponsorship contract and pay your invoice by August 15, 2023 to get your logo on our conference t-shirts for all sponsors Gold and up!* T-shirts are distributed at the conference for in-person attendees to wear at no cost to them. Online attendees will be able to purchase the t-shirt to have it delivered to them from a distributor. Logos will ideally be given in one color on a transparent background and be delivered in SVG format.


#### Opening Party -- $10,000-$14,000

This can be very customized. Sponsoring the opening party is a great way to introduce yourself to our attendees in a fun, lighthearted environment outside the main conference. We'll help you coordinate logistics and get the word out about your company!

#### Lanyard -- *Silver Tier Minimum* -- $3,500

The lanyard sponsor's logo will appear on the badge lanyards that attendees wear at the conference (and thus in all photos).

#### Tote Bag -- *Silver Tier Minimum* -- $1,500

Multiple sponsors accepted until capacity. Logo will appear prominently on our reusable tote bag, which attendees will keep for years to come.

#### Refreshments -- *Bronze Tier Minimum* -- $2,000+

Display your company's name and logo on the break tables next to the coffee, and let us thank you! This add-on is potentially open to multiple sponsors in the Bronze Tier or higher.

#### Invitation Sponsor -- *Bronze Tier Minimum* -- $3,000

Sponsor logo, link, and a brief statement will appear in the email sent to all attendees welcoming them to the conference and providing instructions. This add-on is open to a single sponsor in the Bronze Tier or higher.

#### Opportunity Grant Sponsor

This sponsorship can be of any amount more than an individual ticket and can be with or without a normal sponsorship tier. These grants help us give sponsorship to attendees who could not otherwise afford to come. Sponsors will be added with name, link, and logo on our website.

#### Django Girls Sponsor -- $1,000+

Django Girls will be hosting a workshop aimed to encourage women and other underrepresented genders into Django development, and we are inviting you to sponsor!

Donors will be added to the DjangoCon US break video rotation, get a tote bag insert, and a social media post. This stacks with DjangoCon US tier perks. It's a great value! This is a gender-inclusive event.
