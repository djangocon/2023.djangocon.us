      <h2>DjangoCon US 2023 tickets are no longer on sale</h2>
      <p>But if you want to see what they cost, or need to consult the refund policy, keep reading!</p>

      <h2>Which ticket should I buy?</h2>
      <p>Most people should buy an <strong>Individual</strong> ticket. If your company is paying, they should use the <strong>Corporate</strong> rate (or the <strong>Concierge</strong> rate for more flexibility; see below). For those who can't afford the Individual ticket, a <strong>discounted</strong> ticket is available; see below. And for those who want to go above and beyond and support our mission, check out the <strong>Patron</strong> ticket.</p>

   <h2>What is the refund policy?</h2>
   <p>We would hate for you to miss the conference! But we know things come up, so here's our refund policy:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Refunds requested before October 1, 2023, incur a 10% cancellation fee.</li>
      <li>Refunds requested between October 2 and October 8, 2023, incur a 25% cancellation fee.</li>
      <li>Refunds requested between October 9 and October 15, 2023, incur a 50% cancellation fee.</li>
      <li>The cancellation fee applies to each ticket, including tutorials.</li>
      <li>Requests received after October 15, 2023 at 5:00 pm PDT are not eligible for a refund.</li>
      <li>Tickets may be transferred to someone else at no charge by October 7, 2023, for tutorials and October 15 for the conference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tickets may also be converted to online tickets, in which case the cancellation fee will only apply to the difference between the in-person ticket and the online ticket.</p>

    <p>For all dates the cutoff is on or before 5:00 PM PDT per the time stamp on DEFNA’s servers.</p>
