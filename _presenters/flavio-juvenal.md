I'm a software engineer from Brazil and Chief Scientist at Vinta Software (www.vinta.com.br). I’ve been building web products with Python and Django for the last 13 years. I love drinking medium and light roast coffee and visiting museums around the world. Recently I got into retrogaming and I've been (trying) to fix and play SNES and Genesis consoles.
