Erin has been a developer for over 20 years, starting out part-time while she was in college. She holds a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Philadelphia University, now Jefferson University. Erin works for Energy Solutions, a clean energy consulting company based out of Oakland, California. Previously, she worked for The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Caktus Group in Durham, and for herself for a few years.

Outside of work, Erin contributes to the local Django community by mentoring other women in tech, and by speaking on technical subjects. She has given talks at the Women in Tech Summit, PyCaribbean, the invite-only UNICEF-hosted RapidCon, and at DjangoCon in 2019. In her free time, she loves cooking delicious vegan meals for family and friends, playing with her rescued cats, thrifting, and trying to keep her house plants alive in Hillsborough, North Carolina.
