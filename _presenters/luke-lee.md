I've been developing software professionally for almost 20 years. During that time, I've written device drivers for SSDs, desktop GUIs, and web applications. Now I'm working for Octopus Energy trying to save the world from Climate Change. In addition to writing software, I enjoy writing, teaching yoga, cycling, and chasing my Corgi.
