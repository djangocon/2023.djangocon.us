I've been programming in some form since my early teens. After high school, I went on to get an Honors degree in electrical engineering from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.  I've always been drawn to software development and to teaching. I worked for a string of startups and gained a lot of experience in all aspects of software development, from requirements gathering and UX design to implementation, deployment, and monitoring.

I am currently the CTO of Umuzi. Our purpose is to reduce social inequality in Africa through digital education.

My role at Umuzi is many-fold:

- I create syllabuses to teach critical tech skills
- I mentor learners and staff in technical and "soft" skills
- I help design and set up human/management systems (we have a LOT of people we need to keep on track)
- I write code so we can improve, automate, and modularise our interventions so we can impact more people in meaningful ways

I spend my free time climbing, playing guitar, reading and writing.
