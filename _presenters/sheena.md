I'm currently the CTO of Umuzi, our mission is to reduce social inequality in Africa through digital education. My role involves: figuring out what to teach and how to teach it, writing software (we use Django a LOT), building management systems, creating new products, and mentorship.

Outside of work I like to juggle as many hobbies as I can - BJJ, climbing, hiking and music are high on my list.
