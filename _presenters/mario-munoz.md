I code Python by night, which is what happens when there's not enough time during the day. In the past couple of years, I've presented several talks/tutorials at PyCon US, DjangoCon US, Python Web Conference, and others. Sometimes I neglect/blog on my website [Python By Night](https://pythonbynight.com), and start (and abandon) too many side projects.
