Katie has worn many different hats over the years. She has been a software developer for many languages, systems administrator for multiple operating systems, and speaker on many different topics.

She is currently a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud, where she helps improve the experience of the platform for Python and Django developers. 

When she’s not changing the world, she enjoys cooking, making tapestries, and seeing just how well various application stacks handle emoji.
