Marc is a full stack developer and consultant based in the Greater Toronto Area. He has been working with Django since version 1.4 was released over a decade ago. He specializes in API development and is passionate about developer quality of life.

Marc is a recovered musician who played the oboe professionally with symphony orchestras across Ontario and Qu√©bec. He authored Django REST Swagger, a once popular but now deprecated library used to generate documentation for APIs written with Django REST Framework.

In his spare time, Marc enjoys gravel biking, a hobby he picked up following his first successful battle with cancer in 2020. He founded Port Perry Pedals, an annual cycling event which has raised over CA$ 113,000 for charity since 2021.
