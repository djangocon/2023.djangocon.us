Adrienne Franke works in the Data Science & Analytics department at [Healthcare Bluebook](https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/), where she leads a team responsible for billions of rows of healthcare provider data. When she's not helping her teammates out or removing roadblocks, she's tinkering with an internal Django Admin app or automating boring work away with Python and SQL. In her free time, Adrienne is one half of the electronic music duo [The Feature](https://thefeaturemusic.bandcamp.com/). She also enjoys making apps using Ruby on Rails for fun, going on trail runs, and hanging out with her cat.
