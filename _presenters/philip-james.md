Philip James (aka phildini) has been using Python since a friend used a projector at a summer camp to teach him code basics, changing the entire course of his life from "moody theater kid" to "moody (but smiling) Pythonista". Philip has used Python to help build the Internet at Eventbrite and Patreon, and now uses Python and Django every day as CTO at Burb.

Philip lives in Alameda, in the East Bay Area of California, with his partner Nic, their daughter Alex, and Nic's cat River.
