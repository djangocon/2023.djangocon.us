Two years ago, James and his manager started learning Python and Django to rebuild an internal web app used in their company's call center. An old soul at heart, he started exploring the web before Angular or React ever came along, so the Web 1.0 feel of Django immediately clicked. Today that web app, built with Bootstrap and htmx, is in production use. Going through the process of deploying this app helped him crystallize how to think about getting a project from the code editor to the web browser, and he's here to share those insights and distill deployment down to something more approachable.
