<h1>Branding Guidelines</h1>
<p>The DjangoCon.us brand uses the official Django brand as a base. A case could be
  made for a designer to change the colors and positioning of the date and location
  from year-to-year. However, the goal with this logo is to highlight the casual,
  friendly, professional atmosphere of the conference and can be used for subsequent
  years with minimal alterations.</p>
