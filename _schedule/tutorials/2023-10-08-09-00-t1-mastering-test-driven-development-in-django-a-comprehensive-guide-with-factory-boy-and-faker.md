abstract: Test Driven Development (TDD) has become a widely used methodology in software
  development to ensure code quality and minimize bugs. In this workshop, you will
  learn the fundamentals of TDD and its benefits, along with practical tools like
  factory_boy and faker for pre-populating data factories in tests. You will also
  learn how to write tests for Django REST endpoints, mock 3rd party services, and
  parameterize tests for different user types and roles. By the end of this workshop,
  you will have a solid understanding of TDD and the skills to implement it in your
  Django projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this workshop
  will provide valuable insights and techniques for mastering TDD in Django.

In this workshop, we will learn the followings:

1. What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?
2. The benefits of TDD
3. Introduction to `factory_boy`.
4. Using `faker` to pre-populate the data factories in the tests.
5. Writing Tests for the Django REST Endpoints
6. Mocking the 3rd party services in the tests
7. Parameterizing the tests

After the workshop, you can understand and follow the TDD approach in your Django Project.

You can pre-populate the Django factory models with `factory_boy` and `faker.` In the Django project, you can write tests for different user types/roles and tests for very simple to very complex test cases.
