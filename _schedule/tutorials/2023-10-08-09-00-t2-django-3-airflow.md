As data-driven organizations grow, life gets... complicated

-   data and task pipeline requirement grow
-   more data sources and sinks are added to the mix
-   tasks become dependent on each other in complicated ways
-   service level agreements need to be adhered to and monitored
-   schedules need to be maintained

![XKCD data pipelines](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/data_pipeline.png)

Apache Airflow, initially developed and open-sourced by those nice folks at Airbnb, solves these problems and more.

In this tutorial session, we'll be starting off by getting to grips with Airflow as a stand-alone tool, and then we'll see how we can get it to play nice with Django.

It would be useful if attendees were familiar with Django coming into this session. No prior experience with Airflow is needed.

What we'll cover:

-   What Airflow is all about and what kinds of problems you could use it to solve
-   Airflow development setup
-   Getting to grips with Dags and Tasks
-   Integration with Django
-   Advanced topics
