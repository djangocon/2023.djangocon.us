abstract: "Ref: https://xkcd.com/2054/ \r\n\r\nAs data-driven organizations grow,
  life gets... complicated\r\n\r\n- data pipelines requirements grow\r\n- more data
  sources and sinks are added to the mix\r\n- tasks become dependent on each other
  in complicated ways\r\n- service agreements need to be adhered to and monitored\r\n-
  schedules need to be maintained... \r\n\r\nApache Airflow, initially developed and
  open-sourced by those nice folks at Airbnb, solves these problems and more.\r\n\r\nIn
  this tutorial session, we'll be starting off by getting to grips with Airflow as
  a stand-alone tool, and then we'll see how we can get it to play nice with Django."
