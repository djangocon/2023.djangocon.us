abstract: "Escape from the dark, complex web of modern application development, and
  return to the green pastures where Django began - where web application development
  was simple, fast, and fun.  Hotwire allows us to keep using Django's amazing toolkit
  and all the productivity benefits that come with it, while obtaining the results
  people expect from a modern website.  \r\n\r\nThis tutorial will introduce you to
  Hotwire and radically change how you thought modern web development had to be."

### Have you looked at your React app and asked ‚Äúwhy is this so complex‚Äù?

We're tired of the empty promises of heavy javascript-based build-once run-anywhere frameworks.  They‚Äôve led to duplicated functionality, hacky work-arounds, more than twice the code, and layer upon layer of libraries to learn.

### Enough.

It doesn't need to be like this.  **There is a simpler way**.

This way involves letting Django do what it does best - everything, and letting a light javascript library automatically place things where you need it to go.  We'll be exploring [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), from the brilliant team at [37signals](https://37signals.com/), and will demonstrate how, with minimal changes to your app, you can create a single-page-app entirely in Django without writing a single line of Javascript.

**In this session, you will:**

* Create a React-style single-page-application‚Ä¶*without a single line of Javascript*.
* Update components on your site without a page reload‚Ä¶*without Javascript*.
* Push live HTML updates to your users‚Ä¶*without Javascript*.
* Add the most highly-sought-after engineering skills to your talent stack.  That translates to a **higher salary for you**.

Who knows?  You may even get to see how easy it is to deploy what you've made to the App Store. üòâ
