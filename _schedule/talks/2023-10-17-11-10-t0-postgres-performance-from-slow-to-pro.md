abstract: At some point, every application is limited by the database. You don’t have
  to be a Postgres expert to get started with a few key performance improvements.
  This gentle introduction is meant for folks who’ve never ventured into their database
  before, or those who have been turning knobs blindly. I’ll present how Postgres
  uses memory.  Then, I’ll connect that to how you can monitor, tune, and optimize
  queries.  You’ll be ready to take on the challenge as your application grows.
