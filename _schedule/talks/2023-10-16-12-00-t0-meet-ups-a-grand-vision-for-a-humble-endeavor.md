  our larger ecosystems, what we could work on collectively to support each other,

Meet-ups are one of the best places to bring new people into our communities, but it feels like each one is constantly reinventing the wheel. What if we thought about running meet-ups as a craft and talked about what we're doing there as one of the most important activities that code communities can engage in? Python and Django have built fantastically welcoming communities, and now it's time go out there and bring in the next wave of community members.  

This talk is a love letter to meetups. We'll cover how meet-ups fit into our larger ecosystems, what we could work on collectively to support each other, and maybe even make a plan for saving the world -- one meet-up at a time.
