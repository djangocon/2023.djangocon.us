abstract: The term “legacy code” often evokes feelings of fear and loathing in developers.
  Yet (particularly given Django’s age), working with “legacy” codebases is often
  required of Django web developers. This talk will offer suggestions, drawn from
  experience, for ways to nurture legacy codebases so that working with them is not
  fraught with peril. “Legacy code” does not need to be scary!

---

This talk will begin with a discussion of what is “legacy code” and why it tends to be feared. Then, ways of evaluating a codebase to determine if it is worth nurturing or not will be touched on. The bulk of the talk will focus on techniques for nurturing a legacy codebase, spanning from changes to the code itself (e.g. incremental modernization, automated testing) to ensuring that the past “story” of the code is accessible to all working on maintaining and improving it.  Hopefully by the end of the talk developers who previously would have avoided legacy code at all costs would be open to taking on the challenge.
