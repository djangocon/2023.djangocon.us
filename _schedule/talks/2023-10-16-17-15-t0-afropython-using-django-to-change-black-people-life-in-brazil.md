I'm Felipe de Morais, Co-CEO and co-founder of AfroPython. In this talk, I will share the path of AfroPython in Brazil(http://afropython.org/) and how the Python community was involved in growing and building this community of black people in IT. And how we became a company to help people thrive using Python.
