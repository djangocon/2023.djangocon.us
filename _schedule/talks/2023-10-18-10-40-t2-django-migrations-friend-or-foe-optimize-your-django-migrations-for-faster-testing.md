Django migrations are a great tool for keeping track of changes you made to your models over time.
After years of changes in a project they can become very numerous and you may notice that it takes a long time to create the test database.

`squashmigrations` can help you reduce an existing set of many migrations down to one (or sometimes a few), which still represent the same changes.
However it has some limitations, and it could work in a way you don't need.

Let's inspect this command and the alternative of creating migrations "from scratch" in an existing project for improving your tests speed.

- inspecting django migration commands
    - `makemigrations`
    - `migrate`
    - `showmigrations`
    - `sqlmigrate`
- creating a sample project with multiple migrations
- analyzing test performances
- inspecting the `squashmigrations` command
- squashing migrations in the sample project and comparing performances
- not enough? Let's try an "exotic/drastic" way to squash our migrations
- comparing performances of the "exotic/drastic" solution

The key point of this talk is to speed up django testing in projects with many migrations
