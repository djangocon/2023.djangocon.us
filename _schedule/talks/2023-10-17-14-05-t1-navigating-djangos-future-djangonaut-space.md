Embark on a voyage through Djangonaut Space, a one-of-a-kind mentorship initiative within the Django community. With a focus on collaborative learning, sustainability, and long-term growth, we invite aspiring Djangonauts to join our 8-week group mentoring program. Here, participants work at their own pace in a structured learning environment, setting the stage for future contributions and potential leadership roles within the Django community.

The mission is crystal clear: to nurture Django's next generation of leaders, boost community sustainability, and create a more diverse and inclusive contributor base.

But does this program truly deliver on its promises? Can its unique approach effectively achieve its ambitious goals? Is it the transformative experience it professes to be? In short, will these Djangonauts reach the stars?

With the conclusion of our Pilot Program, we invite you to join us in reflecting on its inception, achievements, and its potential impact on the broader Django universe going forward. Don't miss this opportunity to be part of the discussion and our mission to shape the future of Django together.
