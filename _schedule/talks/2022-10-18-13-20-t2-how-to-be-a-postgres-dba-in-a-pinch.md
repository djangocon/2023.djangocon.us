abstract: We know the open source and Django community loves Postgres - but not everyone
  has taken the time to dig through the docs and learn it at a super deep level or
  has access to a whole DBA team. I’m going to give the audience some of the high
  level things to think about and do on their database if they have to be a Postgres
  DBA in a pinch.
