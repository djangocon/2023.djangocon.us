Most developers don't want to think about operations (aka Ops, DevOps…). PaaS providers (Heroku, Fly, Render, etc.) do an awesome job of getting your app live on the internet, but there's a lot to ops beyond just deployment.

This talk will answer the following questions:

* How much CPU and memory should I give my services?
* How do I know if the app is overallocated (costing too much money) or underallocated (slow/overloaded)?
* How can I make my app faster?
* Will autoscaling help me save costs?
* What about serverless?

If you're a developer and want to run your applications successfully without deep DevOps knowledge, this talk is for you. It will help if you have some basic Django developer experience, but other than that, no specific knowledge is necessary!
