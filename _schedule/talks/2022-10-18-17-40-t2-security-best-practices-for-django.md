abstract: Security is of utmost importance to most applications in general and web
  applications in particular. Django being one of the most popular Python-based web
  frameworks, applications developed using Django are always on the radar of hackers
  who try to find the vulnerabilities in the Django application and exploit the same
  for their benefit. Many times security is ignored or not well done due to a lack
  of awareness and the cost associated with it. But Security is too costly to be ignored.
  Although Django has many built-in security features, they are not sufficient to
  safeguard the application.  The talk begins with highlighting the importance of
  security and identifying security issues in Django applications using the Mozilla
  Observatory tool, then using the recommendations of the tool to secure them. Next,
  I will compare and contrast Mozilla's Web Security recommendations and Open Web
  Application Security Project(OWASP) Top 10 recommendations. Next, I will discuss
  built-in security features in Django. Finally, I will discuss the configuration
  settings and issues that may affect the secure deployment of Django applications.
