title: 'Inside Out: My Journey of Understanding Inclusion'
track: t1
---

In this talk I'll share my personal journey of understanding diversity and inclusion.
Being part of a minority group, I have encountered numerous challenges, I've learned
a lot, and made my fair share of mistakes along the way.

This presentation is an opportunity to reflect on my experiences, sharing the lessons
learned and real-life stories that have shaped my view on the matter. Get ready for a
captivating array of anecdotes!

I'll openly discuss the challenges I've faced and the insights I've gained,
highlighting both successes and shortcomings, always offering a perspective rather than
definitive solutions or comprehensive analysis. I'll cover topics such as tone connotations,
inclusive[n|l]ess of different languages, the importance of company policies, quirks
derived from cultural and social norms, and more. In the final segment of this talk, I
will discuss my recent experience within the Django project and community as a whole.

This talk is not intended to provide a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather to inspire
thought, reflection, and positive change. I hope to encourage open dialogue among
attendees, as we explore strategies for creating a more inclusive, diverse and
equitable environment.
