The djangoproject.com website is the showcase of the Django project and developers and users have always looked for updates on the project, documentation, and information from the Django Software Foundation.

As with its source code, the Django project site is also the result of contributions from many people who voluntarily help to keep it updated and improve it.

In this talk, we will see all the latest updates, ongoing improvements, and upcoming developments of the Django project site.

Participants will be able to learn more about the Django project site, learn more about how it is maintained and above all understand how to help improve it.
