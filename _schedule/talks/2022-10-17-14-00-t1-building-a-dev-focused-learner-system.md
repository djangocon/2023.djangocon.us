abstract: "Once upon a time, Umuzi was an on-premises training provider. We focus
  on teaching high-value digital skills (including Python) to high potential underemployed
  youth. We were based in JeppesTown South Africa and our premises were... cosy. When
  COVID hit us we had to figure out how to keep supporting our learnings remotely.
  \r\n\r\nDjango basically saved our bacon. \r\n\r\nWe didn't just survive COVID,
  we scaled up. We are now supporting learners as far afield as Kenya and Nigeria
  and have attracted funding from the likes of Unicef.\r\n\r\nThis is a tale from
  the trenches, with a good helping of aspiration."

The talk will cover:
- our mission
- how we ran as an on-premises training provider
- the utter chaos of our transition to remote (there were about 250 sim cards registered on our MD's name. Lol)
- how we prioritised what we built
- how we ended up choosing Django
- high level view of how we train different kinds of coders
- where we are heading
