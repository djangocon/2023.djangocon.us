There’s a lot of excitement about Django going async in 3.0+ but also many questions. This talk will provide a brief introduction to async, cover its pros/cons, and show how to build async into your Django app.

We’ll look at four different ways to build a real-time chat app and see how the need for async comes up:

* Polling
* Long-polling
* Server-sent events
* Websockets

Getting async online can be the hardest bit, so we’ll wrap up with a few pointers on deployment to get you on your way.
