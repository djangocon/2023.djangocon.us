abstract: When applications fall short of performance expectations - they are consuming
  too much memory, response times increase, etc. - it can be tempting to increase
  the resources in the environment to respond. At the heart of the issue is application
  performance, and what's missing is a comprehensive strategy that connects production
  monitoring to tools that allow you to identify bottlenecks and enforce performance
  expectations (a performance budget) in development.\n\nIn this talk, I'll attempt
  to show how using Blackfire.io in combination with Platform.sh as a deployment target
  makes it possible to not only create a Continuous Observability strategy across
  every application in your organization, but also how the pair makes it possible
  to make the environmental impact of web development a measurable and optimizable
  objective.
