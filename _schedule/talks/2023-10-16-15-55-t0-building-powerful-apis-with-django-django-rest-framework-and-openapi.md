abstract: "In today's world, APIs have become the backbone of many modern applications.
  Django, one of the most popular web frameworks, along with Django Rest Framework,
  provides a powerful and flexible platform for building APIs. And when it comes to
  API documentation, OpenAPI has emerged as the industry standard.\r\n\r\nIn this
  session, we will dive deep into API development with Django, Django Rest Framework,
  and OpenAPI. We will explore the capabilities of these tools and learn how to build
  robust and scalable APIs. We will cover topics such as API design principles, request
  handling, response formatting, authentication, and versioning. We will also discuss
  best practices for documenting APIs using OpenAPI.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session,
  you will have a solid understanding of API development with Django and Django Rest
  Framework, and be able to create high-quality APIs that meet the needs of your users.
  You will also have the skills to document your APIs using OpenAPI, ensuring that
  your documentation is always up-to-date and accurate. So join us and learn how to
  build powerful APIs that can transform the way you and your users interact with
  your application."

In this session, attendees will be introduced to the world of APIs and learn how Django, one of the most popular web frameworks, can be used to build them. We will explore the capabilities of Django Rest Framework (DRF), a powerful and flexible platform for building RESTful APIs.

In addition, we will discuss the benefits of using OpenAPI for API development, and learn how to leverage it to create robust and scalable APIs. We will cover best practices for API design, including request handling, response formatting, authentication, and versioning.

Throughout the session, we will focus on building RESTful APIs with Django and DRF, using practical examples to illustrate key concepts. Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of how to design and document APIs using OpenAPI, ensuring that their documentation is always up-to-date and accurate.

Whether you are new to API development or looking to improve your existing skills, this session is for you. Join us and learn how to build powerful and effective APIs using Django, DRF, and OpenAPI.
