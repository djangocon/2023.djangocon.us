abstract: "In this talk, we will explore how to work with Neo4j using Python to build
  scalable and efficient web applications. When we think of databases, the first thing
  that comes to mind are relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, but there
  are other types of databases, such as non-relational databases, which are very useful
  and efficient for various problems. An example of one of these non-relational databases
  is a graph database, such as Neo4j\r\n\r\nWe will learn how graph databases work,
  the syntax of Neo4j, how to transform a relational model into a non-relational one
  with simple steps, and examples of queries using Cypher. We will also take a look
  at use case scenario using the Django neomodel library. a basic API using Django
  with the interface neomodel to connect with Neo4j By the end of the talk, attendees
  will have a basic understanding of how to leverage these technologies to build fast
  and scalable web applications."

My talk aims to provide a comprehensive overview of graph databases, going through the basics and fundamentals concepts. 

Graph databases are used for real-time transaction applications, Metadata and Advanced Analytics, Internal Business Process, and much more! There are plenty of use cases for graph databases such as recommendation systems, customer engagement, knowledge graph for AI, and so on.

The best part is that you can visualize the data you store as nodes, and the queries you make as well, so it is easier to identify patterns and relationships within the data. This can help gain deeper insights into the data and make more informed decisions based on your findings.

Also, the attendees will see how it can work with Django, using neomodel as an interface to communicate with Neo4j.

Last but not least, we will dive into some of the graph algorithms, to take advantage of this kind of database and explore possibilities. 

This is an entry-level talk for people interested in databases. Basic database knowledge is recommended.

Weâ€™ll cover:
What is a graph database with Neo4j
Possible use cases
Differences between queries with Sql and Cypher language
How to transform a relational database into a non-relational database
A use case with Formula 1, using Django neomodel library, showing the graph data model, the graph that built and some interesting queries
