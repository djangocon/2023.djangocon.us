title: Announcing the 2022 Schedule!
---

We are beyond thrilled to unveil the 2022 DjangoCon US [talk and tutorial lineup](/schedule/). We'll have six tutorials on Sunday, October 16, three days of talks on October 17-19, and two days of sprints on October 20-21.

We will have three keynote speakers which will be announced over the next several weeks. Stay tuned to our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djangocon) and [news feed](/news/) for the announcements.

We have lots of great talks lined up, from talks about using Django [to support Indigenous people in Canada](/talks/astrodigenous-an-online-portal-for-sky/) or [to help Uruguayans through COVID-19](/talks/ayudapy-org-from-weekend-project-to-key/) to [speeding up your application](/talks/tips-and-tricks-for-optimizing-django/) and [security](/talks/the-software-supply-chain-and-you-how-to/) [measures](/talks/scheming-with-csrf-when-platforms-manage/) and so much more!

Don't forget our awesome deep dive day, where we dig into things like [full-text search](/talks/a-pythonic-full-text-search/), [HTMX, Tailwind, and Alpine.js](/talks/modern-apps-with-django-htmx-tailwind-js/), and a [practical guide to asynchronous Django](/talks/async-django-the-practical-guide-you-ve/).

We'll also have lightning talks on all three days; you will sign up for those in San Diego. Details will be announced later.

If you haven’t purchased your ticket yet, [they’re still on sale](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2022).

As a reminder, the conference runs from October 16-21 at the [San Diego Marriott Mission Valley](/venue/).

We hope to see you in San Diego! 🦀
