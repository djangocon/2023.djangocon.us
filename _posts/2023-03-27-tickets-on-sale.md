title: Leaping Lemurs! Early Bird Tickets On Sale Now
---

We know you're as excited as we are to get your DjangoCon US ticket, and your wait is over! Tickets are [on sale now]({{site.ticket_link}}) and more information is available on our [tickets](/tickets/) page.

Here's what you need to know:

## Prices

- Early Bird Individual Rate: $449 (will increase to $499 once early bird tickets sell out)
- Early Bird Corporate Rate: $699 (will increase to $799 once early bird tickets sell out)
- Patron Rate: $999
- Corporate Concierge Service: $999
- Discounted Rate: $299
- Tutorials: $199 per session

**Patron:** Every year, particularly generous attendees ask how they can pay extra for their ticket to help us expand our mission. If this is you, then the Patron ticket is for you. The cost difference will be put toward conference expenses that increase access to the conference, such as the financial aid fund and video captioning. Ticket holders of this type receive all the benefits of a corporate ticket, and will also be invited to a special "thank you" event at the conference.

## Refunds

We would hate for you to miss the conference! But we know things come up, so here's our refund policy.

If you have an in person ticket and find that you can't attend, please ask about converting to an online ticket.
Otherwise for cancelling in-person or online tickets:

- Refunds requested before October 1, 2023, incur a 10% cancellation fee.
- Refunds requested between October 2 and October 8, 2023, incur a 25% cancellation fee.
- Refunds requested between October 9 and October 15, 2023, incur a 50% cancellation fee.
- Requests received after October 15, 2023 at 5:00 pm PDT are not eligible for a refund.

HOWEVER, remember, in-person tickets can be converted to online tickets at ANY TIME. For that refund amount, we will take the cost of your ticket, subtract the value of the online equivalent, and then apply the same discount percentage above.
PLEASE do not come in person if you feel at all sick of any kind. Even if the conference has already begun, we can help get you connected virtually.
Tickets may be transferred to someone else at no charge by October 7 for tutorials and October 15 for the conference.

For all dates the cutoff is on or before 5:00 PM PDT per the time stamp on DEFNA’s servers.
