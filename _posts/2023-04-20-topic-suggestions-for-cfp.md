title: Need Suggestions for a DjangoCon US 2023 Topic?
---

The DjangoCon US team would like to present some suggestions for topics for DCUS 2023.

# Help, I don't know what I should talk about at DjangoCon US!

Well, you've come to the right place!

## What might I talk about?

- Deep dives into the internals of Django and related libraries (e.g. REST Framework)
- New features in Django (e.g. [facet filters in the Django admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.0/#facet-filters-in-the-admin) and [simplified form rendering templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.0/#simplified-templates-for-form-field-rendering) coming up in in Django 5.0)
- Challenges of using a project like Django in a world where single-page apps (SPAs) are the norm
- Unexpected use cases, especially ones that make the world better somehow
- Clever hacks (such as Carlton Gibson's [single-file Django project](https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/using-django-as-a-micro-framework-on-the/))
- New(ish) libraries and frameworks that make developers' lives easier and how to use them with Django
    - HTMX
    - Alpine.js
    - Tailwind
- Development and testing techniques that help you build better code
- Philosophical debates around code architecture, such as [when to make the call on a large-scale refactor](https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/live-long-and-refactor/)
- Security
- Database tips and tricks
- The Django, Python, and web dev communities: the past, the future, the present, the culture, the why, the who, and the what that makes it all possible
- Using Django in machine learning projects
- Performance and scaling
- Deployment at any size
- Career development
- Ethics in programming: all code we write has consequences and potential misuse
  - The rise of AI chatbots is an especially thorny topic here
- Personal growth: how the community helped you in some way and you'd like to pay it forward

## But I'm not sure if my talk is well-suited for DCUS

We'd love to see you submit it anyway. Read [Sasha's 2015 blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20190625135013/https://www.mxsasha.eu/blog/2015/03/11/why-you-should-speak/) on why you should speak at DjangoCon Europe. Every bit of it applies to DCUS as well.

## OK, Can I ask someone for help?

Sure! We have [speaker mentors](/speaking/speaker-resources/) who would love to help you out in any way they can.

## All right, you've convinced me. How do I submit?

Go to the [Speaking page](/speaking/) to see all the details.
