title: Buy your tickets to DjangoCon US 2023!
---

[DjangoCon US 2023](https://2023.djangocon.us/) is quickly approaching!

So yes, this is one of those "get out there and [buy your ticket]({{site.ticket_link}})" messages.
Discounted rooms at the main hotel are in limited supply and go away entirely September 15, so book your room soon!
Your organizers have been working diligently to prepare for a
fantastic conference this fall. We have amazing keynotes and talks lined up. And [there are tutorials](https://2023.djangocon.us/schedule/#Day-Tutorials) the weekend before
that can be attended from the comfort of your own home. Perhaps you're ready to dive into the world of [Postgres optimization](https://2023.djangocon.us/tutorials/seamless-postgres-query-optimization/). Or maybe you're more into [Airflow](https://2023.djangocon.us/tutorials/django-3-airflow/) or [Wagtail](https://2023.djangocon.us/tutorials/best-of-both-worlds-next-js-wagtail/).
Give the [whole collection](https://2023.djangocon.us/tutorials/) a look and purchase a ticket.

We also have [two days of sprints](https://2023.djangocon.us/sprints/). If you've wanted to be more involved in the Django ecosystem, you'll want to stay for
these. You can learn how to make a code contribution to Django or get started with a third party package. As a bonus,
when you make a commit to Django, everyone applauds and celebrates. It's the most encouraging way to contribute to open source
software.

Beyond the technical stuff, game night is back! We'll also be having a trivia contest and early morning virtual
co-writing sessions. Who doesn't love going to a conference then writing a blog post from a hotel room?! The
organizer of that particular event would tell you that it's way more fun than it sounds.

If you have questions please reach out to us at [{{site.contact_us_email}}](mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}).

See you soon!
