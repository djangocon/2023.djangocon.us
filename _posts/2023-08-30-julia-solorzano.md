I recently sat down to chat with Julia about her upcoming keynote. She is passionate about the history of Django and the community that has grown around it. She is excited to share her thoughts on the past, present, and future of Django. She teased me with some of the details of her talk, and I can't wait to hear more!

### Here's a little more about Julia:

Julia Solórzano is the Security Experience Supervisor for [Login.gov](https://login.gov/) and is based in Durham, NC. She leads security, user experience and engineering teams, and coaches people to help them reach their full potential to create amazing things. Outside of Login.gov, her most recent work includes the [Department of Veterans API](https://developer.va.gov/) program and the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). She is also a professor at Georgetown University where she teaches technology design and development.

She has also worked with clients such as Mozilla, the Python Software Foundation, University of Chicago and Product(RED).

This talk will expand on how Django has sustained itself over the years and where it needs to go in the future.
