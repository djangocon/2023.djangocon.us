title: Announcing the 2023 Schedule!
---

We are beyond thrilled to unveil the 2023 DjangoCon US [talk and tutorial lineup](/schedule/). We'll have six online tutorials on Sunday, October 8, three days of talks on October 16-18, and two days of sprints on October 19-20.

We will have three keynote speakers which will be announced over the next several weeks. Stay tuned to our [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@djangocon) and [news feed](/news/) for the announcements.

We have lots of great talks lined up, from talks about [contributing to Django](/contributing-to-django-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-just-try-to-fix-an-orm-bug/), [using Django to build a BeeWare app](/talks/let-s-build-a-beeware-app-that-uses-django/), [changing the lives of Black people in Brazil](/afropython-using-django-to-change-black-people-life-in-brazil/), [improving your Celery experience](/mixing-reliability-with-celery-for-delicious-async-tasks/), [learning about GitHub Actions](/introduction-to-github-actions-understanding-key-terms-and-building-your-first-github-action/), [catching up on what's new at](/talks/all-about-djangoproject-com/) [djangoproject.com](https://djangoproject.com), and so much more!

Don't forget our awesome deep dive day, where we dig into things like [understanding inclusion](/inside-out-my-journey-of-understanding-inclusion) from Django Fellow Natalia Bidart, [improving accessibility of Wagtail sites](/best-practices-for-making-a-wagtail-site-as-accessible-as-possible/), and learning more about [hypermedia in Django](/back-to-the-future-of-hypermedia-in-django/).

We'll also have lightning talks on all three days; you will sign up for those in Durham. Details will be announced later.

If you haven‚Äôt purchased your ticket yet, [they‚Äôre still on sale](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2023).

As a reminder, the in-person portion of the conference runs from October 16-20 at the [Durham Convention Center](/venue/).

We hope to see you in Durham! üêÇ
