# Are you a working parent? Are you a nursing parent? We want you to attend DjangoCon US! 

## Inclusion for working parents in the DjangoCon US space matters and we want you to know we can help! 


We can assist in connecting you with a local daycare facility, and we will reimburse any child care expenses up to $150 per day.

For nursing parents, we will provide a clean, comfortable, and private lactation space including a small refrigerator to store pumped milk, labeling supplies, and antibacterial wipes.

## Want more information?

Let us know how we can meet your needs and help you attend DjangoCon US 2023 in Durham this October! Please contact us at [hello@defna.org](mailto:hello@defna.org) if you are interested in utilizing DjangoCon US’s child care reimbursement or lactation space services.
