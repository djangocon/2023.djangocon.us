In an attempt to further build the Django community, local groups can be a great way to meet other people, make friends and build your local networks.

With the help of Jon Gould from [Foxley Talent](https://foxleytalent.com/), who has been helping spread local Django groups through [django.social](https://www.linkedin.com/company/djangosocial/), I (Jason Judkins, Blog Comitee Chair) have been able to get my own local group started in Raleigh/Durham area.

So I am pleased to announce that the kickoff meeting for the Raleigh/Durham chapter of [Django Social](https://www.meetup.com/djangosocial-raleighdurham/) group will be also hosting a pre-DjangoCon social on October 6th at 7:00 PM.  This is a great opportunity to meet other people in the community and get to know some of the people you will see at DjangoCon US!

I hope local Djangonauts will come out even if you are not attending DjangoCon to help me start this group and make it a success!
