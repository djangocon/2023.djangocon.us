Hello, everyone! We are very excited to announce that the website for DjangoCon US 2019 is [live](https://2019.djangocon.us). Many thanks to [YupGup](http://yupgup.com/) for the website. It looks amazing!

This year the conference will be September 22-27.

This year we will be returning to the [Marriott of Mission Valley](https://2019.djangocon.us/venue/) in San Diego, CA. Tickets are [on sale now](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2019) and our [hotel block is open](https://bit.ly/2UZ0oQQ). We sold out last year, so take advantage of our early bird pricing! If youâ€™re looking for a ride or room share, [check out this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-O7vSIeSls_xH9w9QVjVrVjgmEciKGduKQRMocCskkk/edit?usp=sharing).

We will open our [opportunity grant](https://2019.djangocon.us/opportunity-grants/) (formerly financial aid) application on April 1.

Now is the time to start getting your submissions for talks and tutorials ready because the [call for proposals (CFP)](https://2019.djangocon.us/speaking/) will open on April 1. We look forward to seeing all of the prospective talks and tutorials!
