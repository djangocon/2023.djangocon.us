Do you want to write more? Do you want an introduction to other Djangonauts? Then perhaps you should attend the virtual co-writing sessions at DjangoCon US this year!

The purpose of these sessions is to help folks write and be introduced to others in the community. These sessions draw inspiration from [Sumana Harihareswara and Jacob Kaplan-Moss' writing accountability team](https://jacobian.org/2021/mar/9/coworking-to-write-more/). These sessions will be focused on helping people write by providing some light structure.

Here's how our sessions will operate:

- Days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (Oct 17-19)
- Start time: [7:30am (US/Eastern)](https://time.is/0730_17_Oct_2023_in_Durham)
- Duration: 60 minutes
  - 5 minutes of introductions and explanation of what you'll be writing.
  - 45 minutes of silent writing (mute your microphones)
  - 5-10 minutes of discussion of session, efforts, socialization.
- Audio only - It's going to be early in the morning for some folks.
- Code of Conduct will be in effect.
- Open to any conference ticket-holder, whether in-person or online.

If you're interested, the sign up sheet will be shared in the conference Slack and email list near the start of the conference. There are no requirements; you're free to utilize this as much or as little as you'd like. Each morning you will join the same Zoom room. From there folks will be shuffled into breakout rooms.

If you're interested, be sure to [buy your ticket]({{site.ticket_link}}) today! If you have questions, reach out to us at [{{site.contact_us_email}}](mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}).
