title: The Call for Proposals for DjangoCon US 2023 Is Now Open!
---

We are excited that DjangoCon US 2023 is now open for talk submissions: [call for proposals](https://pretalx.com/djangocon-2023/cfp)! The deadline for submissions is May 15th, 2023 at [6 PM EDT](https://time.is/0600PM_15_May_2023_in_Durham,_United_States?DjangoCon_US_CFP_Closes).

We invite you to submit your proposal no matter your background or experience level with Django. Proposals can be from a wide range of topics; non-Django and community topics are welcome. You can look at our [talk schedule](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/) from last year for reference.

We fancy first-timers! If you haven’t spoken at a conference or given a tutorial before, this is your invitation to do so. Don’t let the idea that you’re not famous or an expert stop you from submitting. It certainly won’t stop us from selecting your talk or tutorial and it won’t stop the audience from enjoying it!
